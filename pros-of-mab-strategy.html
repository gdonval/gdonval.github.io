</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>This post is the fifth technical post of the <a href="/toc-ab-testing-vs-multi-armed-bandit.html">series</a>.</p>
<p><em>We just showed that the <a href="{filename06-pros_of_AB.md}">A/B testing method has a number of 
advantages</a> over the multi-armed bandit strategy.
At this stage, let us not forget that the multi-armed bandit strategy was
designed to maximize the reward and that it is claimed to behave well in
a set-and-forget mode. Therefore that strategy could require larger sample
sizes and yet provide higher click-through rates. This is what we are going
to&nbsp;investigate.</em></p>
<h1>The multi-armed bandit strategy tends to maximize the&nbsp;reward</h1>
<p>The multi-armed bandit strategy has been developed to maximize the reward.
In our specific case of website optimization, this means that it should yield
the highest number of clicks&nbsp;overall.</p>
<p>In the A/B testing framework, a testing campaign is generally divided into two&nbsp;stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <em>testing</em> stage where the data is gathered (and&nbsp;analysed);</li>
<li>an <em>exploitation</em> stage where the best performing variant is always&nbsp;served.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can apply that complete process to the multi-armed bandit strategy to
compare the methods in similar&nbsp;conditions:</p>
<p><center>
<img alt="Here should be a figure (try with another web browser).
There are two distributions of the total number of clicks
per campaign. The multi-armed bandit strategy does provide a
higher number of clicks.

</center></p>
<p>The two distributions are Gaussian-shaped (therefore we can apply the normal
approximation). The distribution arising from the A/B testing data-gathering
method is mainly located below the distribution arising from the multi-armed
bandit&nbsp;method.</p>
<p>In that sense, the multi-armed bandit method does seem to maximize the&nbsp;reward.</p>
<h1>But is the comparison&nbsp;fair?</h1>
<p>But as we have showed in the <a href="/pros-of-ab-testing.html">previous post</a>,
that comparison is unfair because the A/B testing method provides much more
confidence guarantees at that sample size than the multi-armed bandit method
does. Comparing apples to apples would require&nbsp;either:</p>
<ul>
<li>that we choose a sample
  size around <em>5 times</em> smaller in the A/B testing framework to provide the same
  power as in the multi-armed bandit&nbsp;framework;</li>
<li><em>or</em> that we use <span class="math">\(300\)</span> trials in the A/B testing framework instead of <span class="math">\(600\)</span>
  if we want to provide the same probability of finding the best&nbsp;variant.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what happens when the latter is&nbsp;done:</p>
<p><center>
<img alt="Here should be a figure (try with another web browser).
There are two distributions of the total number of clicks
per campaign with the sample size in the testing stage
chosen to provide the same probability to be correct.
" src="/images/dist_nclicks_mod.svg" />
</center></p>
<p>We chose the sample size in the testing stage so that both methods have
roughly the same probability to select the best-performing variant. As it 
turned out, the two distributions are almost perfectly&nbsp;superimposed.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t that cheating? It like comparing insurances: you can
blindly go to the cheapest or you could go to the 
cheapest providing equivalent guarantees. Is it fair to compare the price of
an insurance which covers only the damage you have done to third-parties
to one which covers your health and&nbsp;goods?</p>
<p>That said, we cannot conclude that A/B testing can generally beat (or even match)
the multi-armed bandit strategy from these data alone: the 
<a href="/big-picture.html">next post</a>
will
be dedicated to that. All we can say is that the claim that the multi-armed
bandit strategy is always better than the A/B testing data-gathering method
is not that strong&nbsp;anymore.</p>
<h1>Can we really set and forget the multi-armed bandit&nbsp;strategy?</h1>
<p>Another way of solving that problem, as stated in the
<a href="http://stevehanov.ca/blog/index.php?id=132">blog post</a>
is to &#8220;set and forget&#8221; the multi-armed bandit algorithm. 
And this turned out to be rather&nbsp;disappointing:</p>
<p><center>
<img alt="Here should be a figure (try with another web browser).
There are two distributions of the total number of clicks
per campaign in AB testing and in the multi-armed bandit
strategy in the &quot;set and forget&quot; mode. AB testing gives higher
numbers of clicks.
" src="/images/dist_nclicks_SAF.svg" />
</center></p>
<p>This time, the A/B testing distribution of values is located at an higher point
than the corresponding multi-armed bandit method in the set-and-forget mode.
Yet, this comparison was reverted to equal sample sizes so the A/B testing
method even provides higher guarantees at the same&nbsp;time!</p>
<p><em>In this post, we showed that the multi-armed bandit strategy does not always
provide a higher reward than the A/B testing data-gathering strategy does
unlike what has been claimed in the original blog post. This could be
considered as yet another proof that this kind of posts really lacks&nbsp;nuances.</em></p>
<p><em>However we have really not proved anything here: we have merely showed some
counter-examples. That is why the
<a href="/big-picture.html">next post</a>
is dedicated to a more exhaustive study to assess when the A/B testing method
is more efficient at gathering clicks than the multi-armed bandit method 
(and&nbsp;vice-versa).</em></p>
