</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p><em>This post is the first of a series dedicated to comparing the A/B testing
method with the multi-armed bandit strategy for the purpose of optimizing
a website.
The Jupyter notebooks with all the code, discussions and conclusions presented
in this series can be found <a href="">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>I recently stumbled across a <a href="https://redd.it/4dlioz">reddit link</a>
to a (now 3-year-old) blog post about the multi-armed bandit
strategy, a method claimed to maximize the click-through rate
even during the data-gathering stage of the optimization process.</p>
<p>That <a href="http://stevehanov.ca/blog/index.php?id=132">blog post</a> is rather
disappointing. Most of the claims
seemed fishy and given the tone and the lack of demonstrations or proofs,
I thought this would be the opportunity to dig into the subject and
compare the methods.</p>
<p>The main purpose (and TL;DR) of this blog series is to restate
the obvious:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A/B testing is a very efficient method designed to answer one question:
"Is there a difference?". It is also very efficient to quantify this
difference in an unbiased way.</li>
<li>The multi-armed bandit strategy was designed to maximize the reward
(i.e. the number of clicks) throughout the data-gathering process.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A/B testing does so at the expense of some clicks and the multi-armed bandit
does so at the expense of correctness and sensitivity. That is all there is
to know... or, is it?</p>
<p>If you are not interested in code (Python), maths or very long posts, feel
free to read the summary <a href="">here</a>. 
For the others, here is the outline of this series:</p>
<h1 id="table-of-content">Table of content</h1>
<ol>
<li>Presentation of the two methods</li>
<li>Construction of the Monte-Carlo models</li>
<li>The pros of the A/B method</li>
<li>The pros of the multi-armed bandit strategy</li>
<li>Conclusion</li>
</ol>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
