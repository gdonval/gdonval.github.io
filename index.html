</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>This post is the seventh (and final) technical post of the <a href="/toc-ab-testing-vs-multi-armed-bandit.html">series</a>.</p>
<p><em>We saw in the <a href="/big-picture.html">previous post</a> that the
multi-armed bandit strategy is not always yielding higher click-through rates
overall. A well designed A/B testing campaign can do as well or better
in less&nbsp;time.</em></p>
<p><em>But before concluding, we need to talk about one last thing:&nbsp;uncertainties.</em></p>
<h1>Uncertainties</h1>
<p>All the calculations we have performed in the previous post were averaged
over a large number of repetitions (typically <span class="math">\(5000\)</span> per point, be it a point
on a curve or a patch on an image). We were allowed to do this because the data
were distributed normally and this allowed us to get very precise values with
a very low&nbsp;uncertainty.</p>
<p>We provided error bands in each of our graphs and actually, the color map in
the images were adjusted so that the not-significant values appeared white.
This is also the reason why we did not provide actual values of difference but
and used a qualitative&nbsp;scale.</p>
<p>For instance, we can compare one&nbsp;image:</p>
<p><center>
<img alt="Here should be a figure (try with another web browser).
" src="/images/diff_vs_sample_size_vs_tot.svg" />
</center></p>
<p>with its corresponding significance&nbsp;map:</p>
<p><center>
<img alt="Here should be a figure (try with another web browser).
" src="/images/diff_vs_sample_size_vs_tot_sig.svg" />
</center></p>
<p>As we can see, the area with the least significance corresponds to
the white area in the original image. This confirms that we designed the
colormap&nbsp;correctly.</p>
<p>But this is not the end of it: until now, we have averaged over thousands of
possible campaigns. What should we expect from a single campaign? Basically&nbsp;this:</p>
<p><center>
<img alt="Here should be a figure (try with another web browser).
" src="/images/diff_vs_sample_size_vs_tot_expect.svg" />
</center></p>
<p>This image represents the amount of overlap between the A/B testing
distribution and the one from the multi-armed bandit strategy. The overlap
is nearly <span class="math">\(100\%\)</span> on all the plane. This means that we would need to perform
a lot of campaigns to really see the difference (as we actually did earlier).
And the difference per campaign should be&nbsp;negligible.</p>
<p>From the multi-armed bandit perspective, this is very good news: even if it
is not actually better at smaller sample rates, this should be hidden in random
variations anyway. The difference should only be seen on the very long term.
<em>In that sense</em>, the multi-armed bandit strategy does provide similar or higher
click-through rates than A/B&nbsp;testing.</p>
<p>Conversely, this means that the penalty induced by a too long testing stage
does not penalize A/B testing that&nbsp;much</p>
<h1>When should I use the multi-armed bandit&nbsp;method?</h1>
<p>As we have seen, A/B testing and the multi-armed bandit strategy can both
yield the same amount of clicks. Each of the methods have their&nbsp;advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>A/B testing provides an unbiased estimation of the confidence in the
    results, it is more efficient at finding the best variant (requires shorter
    testing periods), it can be used in multivariate analysis, it can be used
    to quantify precisely the differences between the&nbsp;variants.</li>
<li>The multi-armed bandit strategy in the set-and-forget mode can is dead simple
    to setup and yet often yields good click-through&nbsp;rates.</li>
<li>The multi-armed bandit strategy in the two-staged mode yields nearly maximal
    click-through rates on a wide range of sample sizes and it adapts very well
    to poorly designed testing&nbsp;campaigns.</li>
</ol>
<p>They also have their&nbsp;drawbacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>A/B testing can only yield a maximal click-through rate on a limited range
    of sample sizes. Determining this optimal range requires that we have an
    idea of the original <span class="math">\(P(O|X)\)</span> value and that we have an idea of the
    improvement we are likely to&nbsp;see.</li>
<li>The set-and-forget strategy does not provide maximal click-through rates.
    It does not provide any estimate of the confidence in its results. It skews
    the data (introduce unexisting difference). It cannot be used in
    multivariate&nbsp;analysis.</li>
<li>The two-staged multi-armed bandit strategy does not provide any estimate of
    the confidence. It skews the data. It requires a bigger sample size to
    provide the same guarantees as the A/B testing method. It cannot be used in
    multivariate&nbsp;analysis.</li>
</ol>
<p>To sum it&nbsp;up,</p>
<ul>
<li>if we have absolutely no idea of the difference in <span class="math">\(P(O|X)\)</span> we are&nbsp;expecting;</li>
<li>if we also have no idea of the original <span class="math">\(P(O|A)\)</span>;</li>
<li>if we don&#8217;t need to quantify the difference&nbsp;precisely;</li>
<li>if we don&#8217;t need to quantify our confidence&nbsp;precisely;</li>
<li>if we can afford to see a difference where there is none&nbsp;and</li>
<li>if we can afford longer testing&nbsp;times</li>
</ul>
<p>then the multi-armed bandit method is worth&nbsp;considering.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>For something that &#8220;is used far too often&#8221;, &#8220;for something that performs so 
badly&#8221;, something that &#8220;is defective by design&#8221;, A/B testing does not seem so
bad, quite the&nbsp;contrary.</p>
<p>It is true that A/B testing provides guarantees that may not be needed in
website optimization in general. In particular, we generally don&#8217;t need
to guarantee through a test that the click-through rates we obtained are
significantly different (well, if we are not doing multivariate analysis).
This defeats the main point of using A/B testing as it was designed to answer
that specific&nbsp;question.</p>
<p>In our point of view, this is what the blogger tried to convey in his
original&nbsp;post.</p>
<p>However, this is not the only guarantee that A/B testing provides and it can
perform just as well while requiring shorter testing periods. The mere
availability of a suitable contingency test is also a big plus as it is the
only way to really figure out whether our results mean something or if we need
to gather more&nbsp;data.</p>
<p>The answer is not all black or all white and this is something everyone should
keep in mind, writers and reader&nbsp;alike.</p>
