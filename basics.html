  <div class="article_text">
    <p>I recently stumbled across a <a class="reference external" href="https://redd.it/4dlioz">reddit link</a> to
a (now 3-year-old) blog post presenting a multi-armed bandit strategy
claimed to maximize the click-through rate even during the
data-gathering stage of the optimization process.</p>
<p>That original blog post was rather disappointing: many bold claims with
very little or no data, demonstrations nor references to support them.
Yet most of the claims are exceptional and therefore require exceptional
proofs. For instance (emphasis is mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>20 lines of code that will beat A/B testing <strong>every time</strong></p>
<p>A/B testing is used <strong>far too often</strong>, for something that performs
<strong>so badly</strong></p>
<p>you can <strong>always</strong> do better than A/B testing — sometimes, <strong>two or
three times</strong> better</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That post really piqued my curiosity and I started my own Monte-Carlo
simulations wondering <em>when</em> these claims would be wrong.
This is what I am about to present in this series of posts.</p>
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->
<div class="section" id="choosing-the-best-option">
<h2 id="choosing-the-best-option">Choosing the best option</h2>
<p>Have you ever been given a choice that you found very hard to make?</p>
<p>Whether you don’t like the outcomes or just <em>don’t know</em> what they are bound to
be, some decisions are tough to make.
Yet, there are ways to estimate what the outcomes would be
by resorting to pure intuition, common sense, existing knowledge, experiments
or even fancy mathematical models.</p>
<p>The web-service realm is full of tough choices like this.
<em>Should I place the image on the left or on the right of the website? Should I
stack the navigation bar buttons horizontally or vertically? Should I colourise
that button in orange or green?</em> etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="website-optimisation">
<h2 id="website-optimisation">Website optimisation</h2>
<p><em>Is that a joke?</em> could you ingenuously say…</p>
<p>Well, did you know that a simple <a class="reference external" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-459X.2012.00397.x">cup colour could change the way you taste
chocolate</a>?
In a similar manner, even a seemingly trifling alteration (like a change of colour)
<em>could</em> have a significant impact on the user behaviour on your website and
consequently on what usually counts: the sales.</p>
<p>Changing the semantics, presentation and behaviour of a website
to favour a particular set of user  behaviours
is what is usually called <em>website optimisation</em>. That optimisation
can be performed using pure intuition, common sense, existing knowledge,
<em>etc</em>. However, some tools have been available for a while to make our
decisions out of real-world data and modelling (e.g. statistics).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="of-time-machines">
<h2 id="of-time-machines">Of time machines</h2>
<div class="figure align-left">
<object data="/images/time_machine.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
</object>
</div>
<p>Now if we think about it, what should we do to to figure out which variant
would provide the greatest number of clicks among our visitors without ever
being wrong?</p>
<p>For instance, let’s say we have two variants of the same website with an orange and a
green <em>Buy Now!</em> button, respectively. We would like to determine which button
would yield the greatest conversion/click-through rate (i.e. the greatest number
of clicks divided by the number of visitors). How can we do this without making
<strong>any</strong> assumptions and be correct each time? I am afraid we would have to rely
on our beloved <em>time machine</em>:</p>
<div class="figure">
<object data="/images/choice.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
</object>
<p class="caption">The only way to guarantee “if we use that variant we will specifically
get a conversion (or click-through) rate of <span class="math">\(P(\text{clicks}|\text{event}) = X\%\)</span>” is to perform the
measurement in different timelines on the entire population (i.e. <strong>all</strong>
the visitors of the website) using a time machine.</p>
</div>
<p>Obviously, with such a machine, it would be possible to increase even more the
number of clicks by providing each user with a variant that we know will result
in a click. But that’s a bit beyond the point here.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="of-statistics">
<h2 id="of-statistics">Of statistics</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, time machines are illegal (they break a handful of physical
laws and trust me, you don’t want to meddle with Laplace demons). So what can
we do? We could begin by making a few simplifying assumptions about the world
and human beings in general:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The click-through rate exists.</li>
<li>It has a definite value that is an intrinsic property of human beings.</li>
<li>That value depends on factors such as the button colour.</li>
<li>Factors other than the button colour (i.e. uncontrolled factors here)
are randomised and their effect on the click-through rate is supposed
to be random.</li>
<li>Large random fluctuations are less probable than small ones.</li>
</ol>
<p>By making these assumptions, we can devise a perfectly legal method to estimate
the click-through rate: given an infinite population, a subpart of it should be
given the first variant (<object class="align-middle" data="/images/orange_btn.svg" type="image/svg+xml">orangeBtn</object>) and the rest should be given the second
variant (<object class="align-middle" data="/images/green_btn.svg" type="image/svg+xml">greenBtn</object>). The click-through rate would be estimated by dividing the
number of clicks given a specific variant by the number of impressions of that variant!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sampling">
<h2 id="sampling">Sampling</h2>
<p>However, there is no such thing as an infinite number of visitors.
So what would happen if we were only given a finite
<strong>sample</strong> of the supposedly infinite population of our visitors-to-be?
We would be subjected to a dreadful situation: <em>we could be wrong</em>.
Alas! We could determine that one variant performs better while it does not!
Sampling is the original sin of probabilities, the one that could cause our downfall.</p>
<p>This is all the more frustrating that a finite number of visitors also has
another insidious effect: if we “spend” all these visitors to determine the
best variant, what should we do with it? No one is there left to be served that
click-enhancing variant. This is why web optimisation is often split into two stages:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">An <strong>exploration</strong> stage where all the variants are provided to estimate the
respective click-through rate of each of them:</p>
<div class="figure">
<object data="/images/exploration.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
</object>
<p class="caption">The exploration stage consists in estimating the click-through
rate on a limited number of visitors. This estimate
<span class="math">\(\tilde{P}(\text{clicks}|\text{event})\)</span> can then be used to
determine which variant should be served to the rest of the visitors.
The population here is already a finite group of people: the website visitors.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p class="first">An <strong>exploitation</strong> stage where the best-performing variant (the one
yielding the greatest number of clicks) is always served:</p>
<div class="figure">
<object data="/images/exploitation.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
</object>
<p class="caption">The exploitation stage consists in providing the variant which exhibited
the greatest click-through rate in the former exploration stage.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These stages summarise nicely why we did all of this in the first place:
gaining knowledge (exploration) in order to maximize the reward (the number of
clicks in the exploitation stage).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-devil-s-tail">
<h2 id="the-devils-tail">The devil’s tail</h2>
<p><em>Problem solved!</em> you said? Hell no! The devil’s in the details: as we said,
the real click-through rate for each variant is hidden by random fluctuations
and these fluctuations are the reason why we could be wrong: determining
whether a difference can be attributed to random variations alone is very complex.</p>
<p>Let’s see… Imagine that we are throwing a 6-sided dice <span class="math">\(1000\)</span> times. We count
the number of time any given side has showed up. Once this is done, we can
calculate how often a given side showed up by dividing that count by the total
number of throws. According to assumptions similar to the ones we made above,
these frequencies are actually estimates of the hidden truth: the actual
probability that any side shows up. We obtained the following values:</p>
<div class="figure">
<object data="/images/dice.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
</object>
<p class="caption">This is the <em>distribution</em> of the frequencies we obtained for each side of
a 6-sided dice by throwing it <span class="math">\(1000\)</span> times. The value <span class="math">\(1/6\)</span> should be
reached for a perfectly fair dice.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>But is that dice actualy fair?</strong> The frequency/probability values alone are <strong>not</strong> enough
to answer that question: what is “too much” of a difference to be attributed to
random fluctuations alone?
can the fairness of the dice really be questioned from these data?</p>
<p>This is the whole point of testing. Similarly, we could ask whether
my <object class="align-middle" data="/images/orange_btn.svg" type="image/svg+xml">orangeBtn</object> variant really performing better than my <object class="align-middle" data="/images/green_btn.svg" type="image/svg+xml">greenBtn</object> variant?</p>
