  </div>
  <div class="article_text">
    <p>Until now, I have spent time (and <span class="caps">CPU</span> power) to precisely illustrate
what the two methods were designed for:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A/B testing efficiently answers the question <em>is there a difference?</em></li>
<li>The <span class="caps">MAB</span> strategy provides the highest click-through rates over a
wider range of sample sizes.</li>
</ul>
<p>As their respective purposes are completely different, thinking of one
of them as intrinsically better than the other is <strong>nonsensical</strong>,
especially as we have shown that <strong>each</strong> method is clearly better than
the other at what it was designed for. Therefore saying that one is
always better than the other is saying that a screwdriver is always better
than a hammer: it makes absolutely no sense.</p>
<p>In this last post, I want to talk more precisely about a few specific claims of
the original blog post to show why I think they were made but also how they can
be misleading and misunderstood.</p>
<div class="section" id="no-the-multi-armed-bandit-strategy-is-not-always-better">
<h2 id="no-the-multi-armed-bandit-strategy-is-not-always-better">No, the multi-armed bandit strategy is not always better</h2>
<p>Let me quote the original blog post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>20 lines of code that will beat A/B testing every time</p>
<p>A/B testing is used far too often, for something that performs so badly.
It is defective by design.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The author seems to completely disregard the actual <em>testing</em> step in A/B
testing. In particular, he never <strong>ever</strong> spoke about confidence, significance or
power. As this is what A/B testing was designed for, I can easily understand
that the trade-off made to achieve this level of guarantees seems “defective by
design” to someone who don’t care whether his results can be trusted or not.</p>
<p>A second explaining element could be a slight misunderstanding
of how a complete A/B testing campaign should be performed.
He seems to think that the data-gathering stage should be as long as a
complete multi-armed bandit campaign (i.e. equal sample size, possibly in a
set-and-forget mode).
Since the asymptotic behavior of the A/B testing data-gathering method is much
worse than the one of the presented multi-armed bandit strategy, that seems
like a huge mistake… The author is right!
That’s why in A/B testing, a <strong>sample size is
chosen</strong> from the start depending on the guarantees we want to have in a fashion
that the author actually <strong>recommends</strong> later in the post:</p>
<blockquote>
There are several variations of the epsilon-greedy strategy.
In the epsilon-first strategy, you can explore <span class="math">\(100\%\)</span> of the time in
the beginning and once you have a good sample, switch to pure-greedy.</blockquote>
<p>If you estimate that “good sample” size using the contingency test, this is a
<strong>precise and exact</strong> description of what A/B testing is.</p>
<p><em>Wait a minute, so what is he comparing his multi-armed bandit algorithm to
then?</em> By disregarding the actual testing and the effect of the sample size,
he is actually comparing his algorithm twice
once at <span class="math">\(\varepsilon = 0\%\)</span> and once at <span class="math">\(\varepsilon = 90\%\)</span>.</p>
<p>As a last comment, I have shown at length that the A/B testing data-gathering
method (aka. 2-staged <span class="caps">MAB</span> at <span class="math">\(\varepsilon = 0\%\)</span>) does beat the
multi-armed bandit method at higher <span class="math">\(\varepsilon\)</span> over a range of sample sizes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="yes-a-b-testing-can-handle-more-than-two-options-at-once">
<h2 id="yes-ab-testing-can-handle-more-than-two-options-at-once">Yes, A/B testing can handle more than two options at once</h2>
<p>Quote:</p>
<blockquote>
[<span class="caps">MAB</span> unlike <span class="caps">AB</span> testing] can reasonably handle more than two options at once.</blockquote>
<p>The blogger is correct there by definition: A/B testing is the two-option
(called, you have guessed it, <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span>) variant of what is
called <em>bucket testing</em>. So while the claim is semantically true, it is
misleading: the method itself can handle as many variant as needed, the only
difference is that it merely <em>changes names</em> when there are only two variants.</p>
<p>In practice, because A/B testing is the presented multi-armed bandit
strategy at <span class="math">\(\varepsilon = 0\%\)</span> plus a contingency test, if one is
capable of handling more than 2 options, the other should (except if the
difference is in the test, which is not the case).</p>
<p>As well, if removing or adding an option in an existing campaign is deemed safe
in the presented multi-armed bandit strategy, it should be considered safe also
in A/B testing because the contingency test does not require that each variant
is provided as often.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="yes-the-mab-strategy-does-skew-the-results">
<h2 id="yes-the-mab-strategy-does-skew-the-results">Yes, the <span class="caps">MAB</span> strategy does skew the results</h2>
<p>I completely share that impression with the author:</p>
<blockquote>
Statistics are hard for most people to understand.</blockquote>
<p>One thing that people seem to have a hard time to understand is that if you
change your sampling behaviour depending on the data gathered so far, it is
highly probable that you are going to introduce a bias that will skew your data.</p>
<p>Back to the original blog post, the blogger claimed:</p>
<blockquote>
Showing the different options at different rates will skew the
results. (No it won’t. You always have an estimate of the click
through rate for each choice)</blockquote>
<p>That claim is rather strange: having data does not mean these data are
not skewed and of course showing different options at different rate
won’t (usually) skew the results… however, as I said, changing these
rates <strong>according</strong> to the measurements most likely will…</p>
<p>So how can I prove that? I already gave an hint earlier in the series in
that figure:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="/images/difference_vs_sample_size.svg"/>
<p class="caption">Difference in click-through rates vs. the sample size for both methods.</p>
</div>
<p>As I said at the time, there seems to be a remaining difference at
higher sample sizes but it is not obvious and really small.
I can plot the corresponding distribution of values at a given sample size:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="/images/dist_difference_vs_sample_size.svg"/>
<p class="caption">Distribution of the difference in click-through rate between the two
variants <span class="math">\(A\)</span> (orange) and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> (green button) at a sample
size of <span class="math">\(5000\)</span>.
They are almost Gaussian-shaped which confirms that we were allowed to
calculate the arithmetic mean and represent it in the figure above.
The real (and hidden) click-through rate are different (<span class="math">\(5\%\)</span>).</p>
</div>
<p>and the same conclusion as above applies: <strong>if</strong> there is a skew, it is not
really visible. The two distributions are centered on <span class="math">\(5\%\)</span> and
roughly Gaussian-shaped.</p>
<p>But let’s try again in a situation where the algorithm is more likely
to switch more often. It would do so by using the data gathered until then
and if there is a skew in the distribution, it should be far more visible that way:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="/images/dist_zero_difference_vs_sample_size.svg"/>
<p class="caption">Distribution of the difference in click-through rate between the two
variants <span class="math">\(A\)</span> (orange) and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> (green button) at a sample
size of <span class="math">\(5000\)</span>. The real (and hidden) click-through rates are equal.</p>
</div>
<p>And here we are: the depression at <span class="math">\(0\%\)</span> should not exist. This proves
that the data is skewed by the method. I could also calculate the difference between
the favoured and disfavoured variant in both methods:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="" src="/images/abs_dist_zero_difference_vs_sample_size.svg"/>
<p class="caption">Distribution of the difference in click-through rate between the
favoured and the disfavoured
variants at a sample
size of <span class="math">\(5000\)</span>. The real (and hidden) click-through rates are equal.</p>
</div>
<p>We can observe that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>in the case of A/B testing, the distribution is a half of a Gaussian
with its maximal value reached at <span class="math">\(0\%\)</span>, as expected;</li>
<li>in the case of the <span class="caps">MAB</span> strategy, the distribution is not Gaussian
anymore and the maximal value is reach at <span class="math">\(0.4\%\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an issue for two reasons:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Actually the individual click-through rate distributions are skewed
too, which basically means that we <strong>cannot trust</strong> any contingency test
performed on the data gathered using that strategy.</li>
<li>There is no way to know whether a given difference is <strong>actually</strong> a difference.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, not only is the correct estimation of a minimal sample size already a
challenge using the presented multi-armed bandit algorithm, testing these
results would also be very challenging because the method itself introduces a
difference that is not accounted for in the testing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="no-test-no-confidence-no-conclusion">
<h2 id="no-test-no-confidence-no-conclusion">No test, no confidence: no conclusion?</h2>
<p>Most people seem to forget completely about the test part of A/B
<strong>testing</strong>. The reasoning here, as seen elsewhere, is that whether or
not the test is positive, what appears to be the best-performing variant
would be used anyway. Therefore the test itself is useless; A/B testing
itself is useless; A/B testing can be replaced with something providing
higher click-through rates.</p>
<p>But the actual <em>test</em> in A/B testing is actually intended as a feedback,
a way to <strong>estimate</strong> your confidence in the results you obtained and
make decisions with both pieces of informations. In contrast, the <span class="caps">MAB</span>
strategy seems to be used far more often relying on one’s “good luck”:
it is <strong>assumed</strong> that the population is large enough to eventually
provide meaningful results and the problem is precisely that this is
<strong>usually</strong> true.</p>
<p>Think of a successful campaign as a light bubble. When you switch it on,
you expect to get light and this is what <strong>usually</strong> happens. The <span class="caps">MAB</span>
strategy is like saying “let’s ask a blind person to turn that light on:
he will move more easily in the dark, in that sense he will be more
efficient for the job”. On the other hand, the A/B testing method would
be more like saying “let’s ask a sighted person to switch it on because
he needs to know whether he was successful and report back”. Yes, in
most cases, the light will be on anyway! However, there is no way to
detect that the light did not turn on for whatever reason in the <span class="caps">MAB</span> strategy.</p>
<p>Mind you, the final and allegedly real results given in the original
blog post do not even pass the contingency test (the minimal
<span class="math">\(p\)</span>-values is only <span class="math">\(0.25\)</span>). So strictly speaking, his
conclusions are questionable, especially given that the <span class="caps">MAB</span> strategy is
known to introduce such a difference.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="section" id="other-drawbacks">
<h3 id="other-drawbacks">Other drawbacks</h3>
<p>There are a few moot points that I did not evoke such as the effect of
time-varying click-through rates, the effect of the lack of
equally-sampled control group, the implications of the actual overlap of
the click-through rate distributions depending on the method used, the
relative spread of the distributions, etc. I decided not to include them
because the most disastrous outcomes would require stringent (albeit not
that rare) requirements. I did not want to weaken the whole series
because some would dismiss these arguments saying “what are the odds?”.</p>

<h3 id="of-hammers-and-screwdrivers">Of hammers and screwdrivers</h3>
<p>As surprising as it may appear, A/B testing and the multi-armed bandit
strategy were designed for two completely different purposes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The purpose of A/B testing is to determine whether or not there is a
difference and provide that answer (with the uncertainties) through a
statistical test.</li>
<li>The purpose of the multi-armed bandit strategy is to maximize the
reward over a large range of sample sizes. Usually it can (and
rigorously should) be used in a set-and-forget mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>These methods are just like a hammer and a screwdriver: both can be used
to do nearly the same thing, yet cannot really be freely swapped.</p>

confidence in the results.</li>

<p>What this post series lacks (as most posts out there) are references: I
am pretty sure that all this work and far far more has already been done
by people out there. Though I cannot personally recommend it (as I have
not read it), I know there is a short <a class="reference external" href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920027393.do?sortby=publicationDate">O’Reilly
book</a>
on the subject of bandit algorithms in general. I also know that there
are a lot of references in Google scholar about both methods.</p>
<p>Literature scanning is not just for scientist: it is necessary to
efficiently reuse the knowledge humankind already gathered on the
subject in order to eventually avoid the traps, pitfalls and
inefficiencies caused by starting from scratch. I am sure a lot of great
minds already worked on this, this is what you should read, not some
random blog posts on the internet if you really want to do things correctly.</p>
<p>As far as this blog is concerned, it just started out as a few tests and
it is mainly intended to show once again that the world is not just
black and white.</p>
