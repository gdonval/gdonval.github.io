  </div>
  <div class="article_text">
    <p>Until now, I have spent time (and <span class="caps">CPU</span> power) to precisely illustrate
what the two methods were designed for:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A/B testing efficiently answers the question <em>is there a difference?</em></li>
<li>The <span class="caps">MAB</span> strategy provides the highest click-through rates over a
wider range of sample sizes.</li>
</ul>
<p>As their respective purposes are completely different, thinking of one
of them as intrinsically better than the other is <strong>nonsensical</strong>,
especially as we have shown that <strong>each</strong> method is clearly better than
the other at what it was designed for. Therefore saying that one is
always better than the other is saying that a screwdriver is always better
than a hammer: it makes absolutely no sense.</p>
<p>In this last post, I am going to</p>
<div class="section" id="the-mab-strategy-does-skew-the-results">
<h2 id="the-mab-strategy-does-skew-the-results">The <span class="caps">MAB</span> strategy does skew the results</h2>
<p>Results are skewed when there is a bias in the measurement process: the
“ideal” measured value is no longer equal to the hidden “true” value.</p>
<p>In statistics, there are a few dragons that are known to almost
invariably skew the results: changing the measurement process using the
measurements themselves is one of them. The problem is that this kind of
bias is hard for our brain to grasp and, oddly enough, this is the very
crux of most probability (false) “paradoxes” (like the Monty-hall
problem, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">wiki
link</a>).</p>
<p>Back to the original blog post, the blogger claimed:</p>
<blockquote>
Showing the different options at different rates will skew the
results. (No it won’t. You always have an estimate of the click
through rate for each choice)</blockquote>
<p>That claim is rather strange: having data does not mean these data are
not skewed and of course showing different options at different rate
won’t (usually) skew the results… however, as I said, changing these
rates <strong>according</strong> to the measurements most likely will…</p>
<p>So how can I prove that? I already gave an hint earlier in the series in
that figure:</p>
<div class="figure">
<object data="/images/difference_vs_sample_size.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
</object>
<p class="caption">If you can’t see the figure, please try another web browser which
supports <span class="caps">SVG</span> images</p>
</div>
<p>As I said at the time, there seems to be a remaining difference at
higher sample sizes but it is not obvious and really small. I can also
plot the distribution of these differences:</p>
<div class="figure">
<object data="/images/dist_difference_vs_sample_size.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
</object>
<p class="caption">If you can’t see the figure, please try another web browser which
supports <span class="caps">SVG</span> images</p>
</div>
<p>and the same conclusion applies: <strong>if</strong> there is a skew, it is not
really visible: the two distributions are centered on <span class="math">\(5\%\)</span> and
roughly Gaussian-shaped (which allowed us to calculate and represent the
arithmetic mean as the expected value earlier).</p>
<p>But remember, what <em>usually</em> introduces a skew is altering some
probabilities somewhere using the data themselves as an input. This
situation is likely to occur more often if the difference in
click-through rates is small or even null. I therefore calculated the
same kind of distributions but in a setup with equal click-through rates:</p>
<div class="figure">
<object data="/images/dist_zero_difference_vs_sample_size.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
</object>
<p class="caption">If you can’t see the figure, please try another web browser which
supports <span class="caps">SVG</span> images</p>
</div>
<p>The Gaussian-shaped distribution suddenly turned into a very strange
one: it is still roughly symmetrical but the expected value
(<span class="math">\(0\%\)</span>) is actually <strong>not</strong> the most probable value anymore.</p>
<p>As we can already guess, we should be able to see what happens more
clearly by calculating the difference between the click-though rate of
the variant which happened to be mostly favored with the one which
happened to be mostly disfavored. The resulting distribution are
represented in the following figure:</p>
<div class="figure">
<object data="/images/abs_dist_zero_difference_vs_sample_size.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
</object>
<p class="caption">If you can’t see the figure, please try another web browser which
supports <span class="caps">SVG</span> images</p>
</div>
<p>We can observe that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>in the case of A/B testing, the distribution is a half of a Gaussian
with its maximal value reached at <span class="math">\(0\%\)</span>, as expected;</li>
<li>in the case of the <span class="caps">MAB</span> strategy, the distribution is not Gaussian
anymore and the maximal value is reach at <span class="math">\(0.4\%\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <span class="caps">MAB</span> strategy therefore skews the data themselves by introducing a
difference where there shouldn’t be any.</p>
<p>This is an issue for two reasons:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Actually the individual click-through rate distributions are skewed
too, which basically means that we cannot trust any contingency test
performed on the data gathered using the <span class="caps">MAB</span> strategy.</li>
<li>There is no way to know whether a given difference is <strong>actually</strong> a difference.</li>
</ol>
<p>These two extra reasons also justify why applying the <span class="caps">MAB</span> strategy to
drug testing and the likes is a very bad idea.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="no-test-no-confidence-no-conclusion">
<h2 id="no-test-no-confidence-no-conclusion">No test, no confidence: no conclusion?</h2>
<p>Most people seem to forget completely about the test part of A/B
<strong>testing</strong>. The reasoning here, as seen elsewhere, is that whether or
not the test is positive, what appears to be the best-performing variant
would be used anyway. Therefore the test itself is useless; A/B testing
itself is useless; A/B testing can be replaced with something providing
higher click-through rates.</p>
<p>But the actual <em>test</em> in A/B testing is actually intended as a feedback,
a way to <strong>estimate</strong> your confidence in the results you obtained and
make decisions with both pieces of informations. In contrast, the <span class="caps">MAB</span>
strategy seems to be used far more often relying on one’s “good luck”:
it is <strong>assumed</strong> that the population is large enough to eventually
provide meaningful results and the problem is precisely that this is
<strong>usually</strong> true.</p>
<p>Think of a successful campaign as a light bubble. When you switch it on,
you expect to get light and this is what <strong>usually</strong> happens. The <span class="caps">MAB</span>
strategy is like saying “let’s ask a blind person to turn that light on:
he will move more easily in the dark, in that sense he will be more
efficient for the job”. On the other hand, the A/B testing method would
be more like saying “let’s ask a sighted person to switch it on because
he needs to know whether he was successful and report back”. Yes, in
most cases, the light will be on anyway! However, there is no way to
detect that the light did not turn on for whatever reason in the <span class="caps">MAB</span> strategy.</p>
<p>Mind you, the final and allegedly real results given in the original
blog post do not even pass the contingency test (the maximal
<span class="math">\(p\)</span>-values is only <span class="math">\(0.7\)</span>). So strictly speaking, his
conclusions are questionable, especially given that the <span class="caps">MAB</span> strategy is
known to introduce such a difference.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="section" id="other-drawbacks">
<h3 id="other-drawbacks">Other drawbacks</h3>
<p>There are a few moot points that I did not evoke such as the effect of
time-varying click-through rates, the effect of the lack of
equally-sampled control group, the implications of the actual overlap of
the click-through rate distributions depending on the method used, the
relative spread of the distributions, etc. I decided not to include them
because the most disastrous outcomes would require stringent (albeit not
that rare) requirements. I did not want to weaken the whole series
because some would dismiss these arguments saying “what are the odds?”.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="original-post">
<h3 id="original-post">Original post</h3>
<p>I’ve generally not spoken about the original blog itself throughout the
series. The main reason is that everyone has the right not to be
completely right and nagging on each moot point would not have been right.</p>
<p>That said, is seems important to indicate that if one does not want to
talk about actual A/B <strong>testing</strong>, but A/B testing <strong>data-gathering</strong>
strategy, it would have been less misleading to talk about <em><span class="caps">MAB</span> with
:math:`varepsilon = 0%`</em> vs. <em><span class="caps">MAB</span> with :math:`varepsilon = 90%`</em> as
it is rigorously what is compared in that post.</p>
<p>As well, A/B testing was not designed in a set-and-forget state of mind:
there are two different stages (<em>testing</em> and <em>exploitation</em>) that must
be used. In particular, conflating the two as done in the original post
is misleading.</p>
<p>Finally, sorry to raise that specific point but it illustrates well the
degree of understanding of the original blogger:</p>
<blockquote>
In the epsilon-first strategy, you can explore 100% of the time in
the beginning and once you have a good sample, switch to
pure-greedy.</blockquote>
<p>is an <strong>exact and accurate</strong> description of what A/B testing is
(assuming the “good sample” part is assessed with a contingency test).</p>
<p>I won’t go further down that road: the point is made and not knowing
that tiny bit is a shame for someone who blogged about it. But it is
perfectly understandable and fine (it happens to everyone and I guess
that series of posts does contain its share of inaccuracies and
incomplete understanding). In particular, this does not make him a bad
developer, far from it.</p>

<div class="section" id="of-hammers-and-screwdrivers">
<h3 id="of-hammers-and-screwdrivers">Of hammers and screwdrivers</h3>
<p>As surprising as it may appear, A/B testing and the multi-armed bandit
strategy were designed for two completely different purposes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The purpose of A/B testing is to determine whether or not there is a
difference and provide that answer (with the uncertainties) through a
statistical test.</li>
<li>The purpose of the multi-armed bandit strategy is to maximize the
reward over a large range of sample sizes. Usually it can (and
rigorously should) be used in a set-and-forget mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>These methods are just like a hammer and a screwdriver: both can be used
to do nearly the same thing, yet cannot really be freely swapped.</p>

<h3 id="when-should-i-choose-ab-testing">When should I choose A/B testing?</h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>When you need to really determine which variant is better (e.g. drug trials).</li>
<li>When you need to estimate the difference precisely (e.g. multivariate analysis).</li>
<li>When you need the shortest testing period possible for a given
confidence in the results.</li>
<li>When you need to know the uncertainties on the results.</li>
<li>When you need to assess that there is actually no difference.</li>

lack too much information (minimum population size, estimate of the

<p>What this post series lacks (as most post out there) are references: I
am pretty sure that all this work and far far more has already been done
by people out there. Though I cannot personally recommend it (as I have
not read it), I know there is a short <a class="reference external" href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920027393.do?sortby=publicationDate">O’Reilly
book</a>
on the subject of bandit algorithms in general. I also know that there
are a lot of references in Google scholar about both methods.</p>
<p>Literature scanning is not just for scientist: it is necessary to
efficiently reuse the knowledge humankind already gathered on the
subject in order to eventually avoid the traps, pitfalls and
inefficiencies caused by starting from scratch. I am sure a lot of great
minds already worked on this, this is what you should read, not some
random blog posts on the internet if you really want to do things correctly.</p>
<p>As far as this blog is concerned, it just started out as a few tests and
it is mainly intended to show once again that the world is not just
black and white by testing some of the original blogger claims.</p>
